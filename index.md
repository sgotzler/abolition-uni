  <h2>A Round Table Discussion</h2>
  <h4> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18HEW_27VDtM16T-CtSQkqi6ZSH8nTQ_nRAT15qp1G8c/edit#bookmark=id.gdr07gurzxlu" target="_blank"> Friday, June 11th, 2021 — Session A (10:00-11:30AM CDT)</a></h4>
</div>

Engaging with this year’s theme of “Anti-Bodies” the round table will explore the potentialities, and the limitations, of abolitionist politics within the university. The anti-capitalist and anti-racist demands for transformative justice of abolitionism seeks to recognize and redress the ongoing social consequences of the university’s historical provenance within the practices of settler colonialism, enslavement, and monopoly capital.

Bringing together several scholars whose work sits at the intersection of radical history, decolonial critique, and critical university studies, the round table will ask us to consider questions such as: What does it mean to take an abolitionist approach to the university? What gets lost if we don’t see the university from the perspective of abolitionism? And what is to be gained?

The session will also prompt discussants to respond to questions concerning the practical realization of abolitionism in the university today, for instance exploring: What unique challenges does the terrain of an institution like the university present, when compared with other more repressive state apparatuses subjected to abolitionist critique such as prisons and policing? What pitfalls await demands for abolition in the wake of the widespread austerity measures sweeping higher education since the outbreak of COVID-19? How can we push to realize university abolition in practical terms, through our labor as instructors, faculty members, advisors, graduate students, and scholars?
